# 🏺 Egyptian Artifact Chatbot

This project scrapes real-world artifact data from the [Global Egyptian Museum](https://www.globalegyptianmuseum.org), using NLP, analyzes image similarity, and wraps it all into a chatbot interface for inquiry.





##  To Run

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 spacy opencv-python numpy matplotlib
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```


## My Goal for this project

Wanted to build something tangible to develop a simple bot and create a project about connecting with real cultural data, seeing how far Python alone can go in making static artifacts interactive.
